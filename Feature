The QuantTrigonometric feature engineering is a technique used in data science and machine learning to create new features or variables from existing numerical data by applying trigonometric functions such as sine, cosine, and tangent.

Trigonometric functions are periodic functions that repeat themselves over a regular interval. By applying these functions to numerical data, we can transform the data into a new representation that highlights the periodicity or cyclical nature of the data.

For example, if we have a dataset with time series data that shows hourly temperatures throughout a day, we can use trigonometric feature engineering to create new features that capture the cyclical nature of temperature fluctuations. We can do this by applying sine and cosine functions to the hour of the day variable.

The sine function will give us a value that varies between -1 and 1 and represents the amplitude of the temperature fluctuations at a specific time. The cosine function will give us a value that varies between -1 and 1 and represents the phase or position of the temperature fluctuations in the cycle.

These new features can be used in machine learning models to improve their accuracy and performance, especially when the original data has a cyclical or periodic pattern. Trigonometric feature engineering can also be applied to other types of data, such as spatial data or time series data with different periodicitiesile Transformer Scale is a data transformation technique used in machine learning to scale and transform numerical data to a uniform distribution.

In this method, each feature is transformed separately by computing the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the feature values, then applying the inverse CDF of a uniform distribution to the resulting values. This results in transformed feature values that follow a uniform distribution between 0 and 1.


Fourier features is a technique of feature engineering that transforms data from the input space into a high-dimensional space by mapping it onto a set of sine and cosine functions. This is achieved by applying a Fourier transform to the input data.

The basic idea behind Fourier features is that any periodic function can be expressed as a sum of sine and cosine functions. By mapping the input data to this high-dimensional space of sine and cosine functions, we can capture complex patterns that may be difficult to represent using simple linear or polynomial features.

To use Fourier features, we first define a set of frequencies that we want to capture. We can then apply the Fourier transform to the input data to obtain the Fourier coefficients for each frequency. These coefficients can be used as the features for the input data.

For example, suppose we have a one-dimensional input space with a periodic pattern that repeats every 2Ï€ units. We could define a set of frequencies as follows:

frequencies = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

We can then apply the Fourier transform to the input data to obtain the Fourier coefficients for each frequency:

coefficients = [a0, a1, b1, a2, b2, a3, b3, a4, b4, a5]

These coefficients can be used as features for the input data. By using a large number of frequencies, we can capture complex patterns in the input data.

Fourier features can be used in a variety of machine learning models, including linear regression, logistic regression, and neural networks. They are particularly useful for tasks that involve periodic patterns, such as time series analysis and signal processing.



Normalizer scaling is a technique used in machine learning to rescale input data to a fixed range, typically between 0 and 1. It is a type of feature scaling that is useful for algorithms that are sensitive to the scale of the input features.

Normalizer scaling involves dividing each feature value by the L2-norm of the feature vector. The L2-norm is the square root of the sum of the squared values of the feature vector. This ensures that each feature value is scaled by the same factor and that the resulting feature vector has a length of 1.
