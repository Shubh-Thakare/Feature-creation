# Recency of an item can be a useful feature in many machine learning applications, particularly those related to recommender systems, where the goal is to recommend items to users based on their past preferences. Here are a few ways to incorporate recency into feature engineering:

Time since last interaction: One simple way to incorporate recency into feature engineering is to calculate the time since the user last interacted with the item. This can be useful in situations where users are more likely to be interested in items that they have recently interacted with.

Time since item was added: Another way to incorporate recency is to calculate the time since the item was added to the system. This can be useful for new items that have not yet been interacted with by many users.

Decay function: In some cases, the recency of an item may not have a linear relationship with its relevance to the user. For example, a user may be more interested in an item that they interacted with yesterday than an item they interacted with a week ago, but the difference in relevance may not be proportional to the difference in time. In such cases, a decay function can be used to model the relationship between recency and relevance.

Temporal features: Temporal features, such as the day of the week or time of day that the item was interacted with, can also be useful in incorporating recency into feature engineering. For example, a user may be more likely to interact with certain types of items during specific times of the day or week.


DataRobot's Feature Discovery tool is a feature engineering tool that automatically identifies important variables or features that can be used to build more accurate predictive models. It works by analyzing the relationships between variables in a dataset to identify which variables are most strongly correlated with the target variable.

The tool uses a combination of statistical and machine learning algorithms to explore the data and identify the most relevant features. It can also detect interactions between variables, such as nonlinear relationships or interactions between categorical variables, that may be missed by more traditional feature selection methods.

Once the most relevant features have been identified, the tool can automatically generate new features by combining existing ones in a meaningful way. This can lead to more accurate models and better predictions.

Overall, DataRobot's Feature Discovery tool can save data scientists a significant amount of time and effort in the feature engineering process, allowing them to focus on other aspects of the data science workflow.
